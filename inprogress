One of the nicest problems that you could ever have is that you have a
service that is just so popular, that it struggles to handle serving all
of your users. It is certainly a much better problem to have than not
having any users at all!

near enough for it to break a sweat, we will simulate a higher load on a
weaker instance to demonstrate the issues and how they can be solved.
